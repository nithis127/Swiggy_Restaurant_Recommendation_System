# 🍴 Swiggy Restaurant Recommendation System

## 📌 Problem Statement

Food delivery platforms like Swiggy offer thousands of restaurant choices across multiple cities. Choosing a suitable restaurant based on personal preferences (**city, cuisine, cost, rating**) becomes challenging for users.

The goal of this project is to develop a **restaurant recommendation system** that suggests top restaurants to users by analyzing **cuisine patterns, location, and restaurant similarity** using machine learning techniques. The recommendations are presented in a **Streamlit application** with an interactive interface.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 📥 Load and explore Swiggy restaurant dataset  
- 🧹 Perform data cleaning and handle missing values  
- 🧠 Apply One-Hot Encoding and Multi-Label Binarization for categorical features  
- 📏 Standardize numerical attributes  
- 🤖 Build a similarity-based recommendation system using **Cosine Similarity**  
- 🔄 Map recommendation results back to cleaned data  
- 🎨 Deploy recommendation system with a **Swiggy-themed Streamlit UI**

## 🧠 Model Building Summary

### ✔ Feature Cleaning 🧹

- Set `"id"` column as index  
- Dropped non-predictive columns: `"lic_no"`,`"link"`,`"address"`,`"menu"`  
- Removed duplicate records  
- Dropped missing `"name"` and `"cuisine"` rows  
- Cleaned `"rating"` and `"rating_count"` using custom rules  
- Converted `"₹cost"` → integer  

---

### ✔ Feature Transformation 🔄

- Split `"city"` into `"City"` and `"Area"`  
- Converted `"cuisine"` into multiple labels  

---

### ✔ Encoding & Scaling 📏

- Applied **MultiLabelBinarizer** for multiple cuisines  
- Applied **OneHotEncoder** for City and Area columns  
- Standardized `"rating"`, `"rating_count"`, `"cost"`  
- Saved processed dataset as:
  - 📄 `cleaned_data.csv`
  - 📄 `encoded_data.csv`

---

## 🤖 Recommendation System Summary

- 🏙️ Filtering based on selected **City**  
- 🧠 Matching restaurants using **Cosine Similarity**  
- 🍛 Cuisine-based partial matching  
- 📋 Displaying:
  - Restaurant Name  
  - Rating & Rating Count  
  - Cost for Two  
  - Cuisine  
  - Area  
- 📊 Sorted based on **similarity** or **rating**  

---

## 🖥️ Streamlit Deployment

- 🎨 Swiggy-themed UI with custom CSS  
- 🧭 Sidebar filters:
  - 🏙️ Select City  
  - 🍜 Select Cuisine(s)
